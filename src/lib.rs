//! ```
//! use pfp::passwords::Passwords;

//! use std::path::Path;
//!
//! let io = FileIO::new(Path::new("test.json"));
//! let passwords = Passwords::new(io);
//!
//! // Password storage will be uninitialized because the file doesn't exist yet.
//! assert!(passwords.initialized().is_err());
//!
//! // Password storage will be locked because we didn't set the master password yet.
//! assert!(passwords.unlocked().is_err());
//! ```
